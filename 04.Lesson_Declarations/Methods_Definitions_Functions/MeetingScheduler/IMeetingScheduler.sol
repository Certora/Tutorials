/** Meeting Scheduler Overview
 * @dev This contract simulates a meeting scheduler for various uses.
 * 
 * The scheduler follows a clear path through the different states of a meeting's life.
 * The system allows one to create a schedule, defining the start and end times of the meeting.
 * The scheduler also tracks the number of participants attending the meeting.
 *
 * The meetings in the system are going through the following states: 
 * - Before creation, they are classified as UNINITIALIZED.
 *
 * - At creation, the meeting's state changes to PENDING, the start and end times are set according to the 
 * organizer's order, and the number of participants is nullified.
 *
 * - Anybody can start a PENDING meeting if the start time has arrived (the meeting's status 
 * changes to STARTED).
 * -A meeting's owner be cancel it (changes to CANCELLED) by its owner. A meeting that has already
 * occurred can not be labeled CANCELLED.
 *
 * - When the end time arrives, a STARTED meeting becomes ENDED.
