/*  Representing enums

    enums are supported by the Certora Verification Language (CVL), 
    according to their low level representation - uint8.
    in our case:
        -UNINITIALIZED = 0
        -PENDING = 1
        -STARTED = 2
        -ENDED = 3
        -CANCELLED = 4
    so for example if we write 'state == 0' we mean 'state == UNINITIALIZED'
    or 'state % 2 == 1' we mean 'state == PENDING || state == ENDED'.

    We will learn more about supported data structures in future lessons,
    for now follow the above explanation to pass this exercise.

/* f.selector

 * The use of f.selector is very similar to its use in solidity -
 * since f is a parametric method that calls every function in the contract in parallel,
 * we specify (or select) to address one particular path - when the f.selector was a specific function.
