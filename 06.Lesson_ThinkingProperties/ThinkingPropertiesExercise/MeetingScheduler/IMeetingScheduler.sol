/** Meeting Scheduler Overview
 * @dev This contract simulates a meeting scheduler for various uses.
 * 
 * The scheduler follows a very clear path through different states of a meeting's life.
 * The system allows one to create a schedule, defining the start and end times of the meeting.
 * The scheduler also tracks the number of participants attending the meeting.
 *
 * - The meetings in the system are going through the following states - before creation, they are
 * classified as UNINITIALIZED.
 *
 * - At creation, the state changes to PENDING, the start and end times are set according to 
 * the organizer's order, and the number of participants is nullified.
 *
 * - Anybody can start (change it to STARTED) a PENDING meeting. The owner of A PENDING meeting 
 * can cancel it (change it to CANCELLED) by the owner. A meeting that has already occurred can 
 * not be labeled CANCELLED.	
 *
 * - If the meeting has already started and the end time has arrived, anybody can change its 
 * status to ENDED.
