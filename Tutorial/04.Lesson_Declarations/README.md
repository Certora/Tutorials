# Additional Concepts In CVL (Certora Verification Language)

</br>

- [ ] Go over the following sources of free and public information to learn how to think of systems as state machines:
    
    - [ ] Part of a lecture explaining the idea of state machines[^1]. Watch the video from 48:58 to 1:02:45 - [Link](https://youtu.be/cQntMUMQyRw?t=2938)
    
    - [ ] A recitation on state machines for the same course[^1] - [Link](https://youtu.be/8FWfmvj3HYw).

    - [ ] A short written explanation on state machines - [Link](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs211/2006sp/Lectures/L26-MoreGraphs/state_mach.html)

> :memo: If you feel you need some more explanations of the subject you can search the web for many additional great and free sources.

- [ ] Follow the instructions on [Methods_Definitions_Functions](Methods_Definitions_Functions) to learn about method declarations, definitions, and functions in CVL, and exercise the concepts.

</br>

- [ ] Read the documentation on [Types and Type Handling](https://certora.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CPD/pages/7340101/Types) to learn about the different CVL types available to use, their distinction from EVM types, casting operations, and useful macros.
